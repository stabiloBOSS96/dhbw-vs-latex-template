# DHBW-VS academic text LaTeX template

This is a LaTeX template for academic text assignments at the [DBHW-VS](https://www.dhbw-vs.de/), especially for business computer science students. Created along [the specifications](misc/specs.md) written by Mrs. Heinrich. It is intended to save time by using this template because you can focus on the content of the text instead of worrying about the formatting in WYSIWYG (**W**hat **y**ou **s**ee **i**s **w**hat **y**ou **g**et) text editors like [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or [Microsoft Word](https://products.office.com/word).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

> These setup instructions apply to **Windows** only. You should however be able to use my template on Linux and MacOS as well.

#### Install LaTeX

Obviously you have to install LaTeX itself. There are multiple distributions, I recommend using [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/).

> If you run into trouble with the TeX Live installer, download the [ISO](https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-iso.html) instead and extract it to `C:\texlive`.

#### Install Biber

[Biber](https://github.com/plk/biber) is the backend processor for BibLaTeX (which replaces BibTeX). You have to install it in order to use this template. [Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/files/latest/download) the latest executable and save it to `C:\texlive`.

#### Install the LaTeX editor of your choice

* Recommended: **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the [LaTeX Workshop extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) and a [spelling checker](https://github.com/Jason-Rev/vscode-spell-checker)**.
* Legacy alternatives: [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/)

#### Optional: Install git (works great with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/))

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Setup

1. [Setup](#Prerequisites) your writing environment.
1. [Download](https://github.com/Skyfr3ak/dhbw-vs-latex-template/releases) and extract this template. If you are using git you can use `git clone` instead.
1. Open `root.tex` with your editor of choice.
1. Customize `misc/properties.tex` to your needs.
1. Start writing your text in `pages/text.tex`. Easy as that!
1. Compile your work. The final pdf file will be in the same directory as the `root.tex` file.

### Examples

#### Create sections

```tex
\section{Living beings} % top level caption
\section*{Living beings} % top level caption, unnumbered
\subsection{Humans}
\subsubsection{Chuck Norris}
```

#### Cite direct

```tex
\glqq Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.\grqq{}\myfootcite[42]{hitchhiker}

% '42' is the number of the page in the source you are citing from.
% 'hitchhiker' is the name of your source in your .bib literature file.
% '\glqq' and '\grqq{}' generate the german quotes.
```

#### Cite indirect

```tex
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.\myfootcite[Vgl.][42]{hitchhiker}

% '42' is the number of the page in the source you are citing from. Can be blank.
% 'hitchhiker' is the name of your source in your .bib literature file.
% 'Vgl.' is the prefix of the short reference in the footnote.
```

#### Acronym

```tex
% in the file pages/acronym.tex
\acro{NiP}{Ninjas in Pyjamas}

% in the text
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, \ac{NiP} consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.

% If the acronym was used for the first time \ac{} will genrate:
% [...] sit amet, Ninjas in Pyjamas (NiP) consetetur sadipscing [...]
% If the acronym was not used for the first time \ac{} will genrate:
% [...] sit amet, NiP consetetur sadipscing [...]
```

#### Figure

```tex
% include image
\begin{figure}[ht] % ht means that the figure should appear at this exact position
\centering
\caption{Interesting caption}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{file-name} % put your pictures into ./figures/
\caption*{\footnotesize{Source: Some website}}
\label{fig:goodreference} % add a reference label
\end{figure}

% refer to a figure
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet \autoref{fig:goodreference} consetetur sadipscing elitr.
% will resolve to:
% Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet figure 1 consetetur sadipscing elitr.
```

#### Reference to a figure or a section

```tex
As you can see in \autoref{fig:twosweetcats} there are cute cats in the world.
```

#### Let text wrap around a figure

```tex
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth} % use wrapfigure instead of figure
\centering
\caption{Interesting caption}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{file-name}
\caption*{\footnotesize{Source: Some website}}
\label{fig:goodreference} % add a reference label
\end{wrapfigure}
```

#### Add a source to the bibliography

Add your entries to `/misc/literature.bib`. You always have to provide a `shorttitle`. If `edition=1` delete the edition key.

```tex
@book{key,
    author = {Firstname Lastname and Otherfirstname Otherlastname},
    title = {Title},
    shorttitle = {Shorttitle},
    year = {1996},
    edition = {2},
    publisher = {Some company},
    location = {Berlin}
}

@online{anotherkey,
    author = {Lastname, Firstname},
    title = {Title},
    shorttitle = {Shorttitle},
    date = {2016-06-20},
    url = {https://somedomain.com},
    urldate = {2015-10-21}
}
```
